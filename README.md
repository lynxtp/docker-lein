## Usage

First, download and install the
[Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).

To build the container from scratch, run `make`, or skip this step to use a
pre-built container from the
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lynxtp/lein).

To run the [lein command-line tool](http://leiningen.org), run `./lein`. The
lein command will have access to the current working directory and all
subdirectories.
